# Keepsake: Accounting System

Keepsake is an accounting system based on the [Double-entry bookkeeping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-entry_bookkeeping_system) principle.

## Getting Started

Keepsake is general enough to be useful for any small organisation or for home accounting.

The system is run as a web service, the user interface is delivered to a web browser.

### Prerequisites

The system has been tested only in GNU/Linux Ubuntu 16.04 and the installation instructions are address to install the system in the same operating system. However, there is no limitation to deploy it in a different Unix-like operating system.

The system could run as a stand-alone web server or as fast-cgi process in a web server as Apache. The stand-alone server is practical for developing and testing, while the fast-cgi process is apropiate for production usage.
